## Mapper Interactive Documentation

Mapper Interactive is a web-based framework for interactive analysis and visualization of high-dimensional point cloud data built upon the Mapper algorithm. It is an open source software released under the MIT License.

The Mapper algorithm is a tool from topological data analysis first introduced by Gurjeet Singh, Facundo Mémoli and Gunnar Carlsson in 2007 (http://dx.doi.org/10.2312/SPBG/SPBG07/091-100).

Please find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/MapperInteractive/MapperInteractive).
